Assumptions:
Each word is independent of the other
Stop words are ignored
If the text in any file doesnt contain the word 'Lines' it will ignore that whole file. As the criteria is to find the word 'Lines' first and after that consider all words as features.

"stopwords.txt" file should be kept in the same folder where the program is kept.
It contains a list of stopwords.

Results:
For different sub sets of folder, accuracy on test data set kept on changing.
Lowest was around 69% and highest was around 95%.
